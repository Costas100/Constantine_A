    <h1>I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</h1>

  <body><p>Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.</p>
<p>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. <strong> There'll be no one to stop us this time!</strong> <em> Oh God, my uncle.</em> How am I ever gonna explain this?</p>
<h2>You don't believe in the Force, do you?</h2>
<p>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</p>

<li>You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!</li><li>I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.</li><li>Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Ye-ha!</h3>
<p>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.</p>
<ul>
<li>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.</li><li>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.</li><li>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</p>
<p>I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</p>
<p>All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.</p>
<p>The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--</p>
<p>What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--</p>
<p>You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</p>
<p>Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</p>
<p>As you wish. You don't believe in the Force, do you? I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</p>
<p>I call it luck. I'm trying not to, kid. Don't underestimate the Force. As you wish. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.</p>
<p>Ye-ha! I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</p>
<p>I find your lack of faith disturbing. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--</p>
